                    But I want to highlight how I can stand out from the other developers at the same stage as me<br><br>
                    I consider myself as a problem solver and challenge accepter. If my clients/friends ask me to attempt something new which I’ve never come across or have barely any exposure to but realise it can become beneficial for me in future; I will attempt it regardless of the time and stress involved with the challenge.<br><br>
                    Let’s take this Website as an example<br><br>
                    This is my second project in HTML & CSS after I created my first project back in 2016 (a simple e-commerce website). I clearly did not know how to implement this but I still wanted to attempt this because I needed a place to showcase myself. Therefore, I spent majority of my time on Stack Overflow and W3School learning new design combinations and fixing small bugs. Not only this, but I was also able to find other programmers (found online) to assist me in completion of this project at stages which I couldn’t fix. Plus, it’s always best to have second opinion (he likes the project).

I wanted to have a career with intense problems and potential of creating solutions for users and that’s when I noticed that computer science is the subject for me.

Not only obtain feedback but also get points based on how good my design is. I strongly believe that UpLabs is the place I go to for inspiration because it worked in the past for one of my College project. Furthermore, it’s also capable of providing some ideas which I can potentially try to create via code.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, UpLabs will be the place where I will showcase my new designs and ideas before I begin the implementation process. As the votes will determine if it’s worth implementing the design or if it requires the design to be re-considered.
