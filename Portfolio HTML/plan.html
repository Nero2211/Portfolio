        <!--TALK ABOUT MY MAIN AMBITION
            1. RATHER THAN USING TOOLS TO CREATE APPS, CREATE MY OWN TOOL ONE DAY
            2. CONSTANTLY LOOK FOR NEW DESIGNS AND GET TO THE TOP ON UPLABS
            3. GOOD GROUND FOUNDATION ON JAVA, C#, HTML/CSS; PHOTOSHOP, ADOBE AFTER EFFECTS AND OTHER MEDIA-->
        <h2>PLAN</h2>
        <p>
            I've a clear path which I will follow and ensure that I am able to achieve desired skills and knowledge to become the developer in my most interested fields. Being a developer in variety of languages is my ultimate goal because I do not want to restrict myself to a single programming language but make myself universal for variety of platform and purposes. At this moment of time, I consider myself a Junior Developer in only Java but I am willing to push my boundaries in my free time to be able to build some expertise in Java as well as other programming languages.<br><br>
            When I came out of university, I had a clear mindset of not be out-dated or restrict myself to only single programming language. I knew that languages which I'll have to learn and the key benefits of these programming languages.

                <h1>Java</h1>
                <p>Android was the platform in which I was able to learn and develop applications using Java. However, I do not want to restrict myself just on Android platform. I am going to start using Java on various other platforms i.e. Web Development or even CRM System (Salesforce). For starters, this will require more research on my side to be able to understand the benfits of Java and where else to apply it.</p>

            <div class="column" style="margin-top: 30px">
                <h1>C#</h1>
                <p>Microsoft have been pushing new updates on Visual Studio throughout the years and I want to be able to partcipate in .net development. Therefore, building my expertise in C# is also part of my plan and will hopefully achieve a project throughout 2018. My plan to use C# will only be for Windows desktop applications at this stage.</p>

            <div class="column" style="margin-top: 30px">
                <h1>Swift</h1>
                <p>It's ignorant to ignore the compition of one of my favourite platforms (android). As to becoming a developer, I need to be able to fully maximise myself and cover the key platforms in today's market. Mobile development is a major market and the two major platforms in the mobile market are Android and IOS. Therefore, I will also start to develop in Swift for Apple devices.</p>
