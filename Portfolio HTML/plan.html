Being a developer in variety of languages is my ultimate goal because I do not want to restrict myself to a single programming language but make myself universal for variety of platform and purposes. At this moment of time, I consider myself a Junior Developer in only Java but I am willing to push my boundaries in my free time to be able to build some expertise in Java as well as other programming languages.<br><br>
                    When I came out of university, I had a clear mindset of not be out-dated or restrict myself to only single programming language. I knew that languages which I'll have to learn and the key benefits of these programming languages.

                    The meaning of life, or the answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?", pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question.</p>
