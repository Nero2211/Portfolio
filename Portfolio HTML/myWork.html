                        Most of my work is Java related at this stage as this was the programming language which attracted my focus at the first instance. This is mainly to do with android application as I am a big fan of android and I know the potential of smart phone applications and it's market. Not only for simple programming but this language also has the potential of being converted into gaming which may attract me interest in near future.

                        The aspect I love about C# is the similarity it has with Java programming. The similarities are syntaxes and features that are used within the tools make programming easier than expected. C# was the first language in which I made my first ever working and fully functional self service desktop application. Since then I have not touched C# until recently and when I reviewed the syntaxes and click methods, it reminded me a lot of Java and after few searches on Stack Overflow, I was able to achieve desired results instantly (ofcourse I was only testing dummy applications).

                        Presence in the Web Browser is just as important as on smart phones/devices. Therefore, web development is something I am also looking to participate in because the first aspect of programming which I wanted to learn was "How to make websites". Today I know how to make websites but I do not know how to make effective, appealing, interesting and unique websites. This enspires me to be more involved with gaining more knowledge in web programming as well as learning jQuery and PHP.
