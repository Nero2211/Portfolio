            During my free time I love to get my hands dirty in coding and implement new solutions/applications when possible. Through the whole application building life cycle; implementation stage is my favourite because that's the stage where I can see my idea come to life. However, I strongly do believe a suitable methodology is needed in place to be able to fully justify the project. A suitable appraoch for the project can save resources, time as well as keep everything on track and that's going to be my new challenge which would be to keep everything in a plan, in place and DOCUMENTED.</p>

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>I really enjoy coming up with new designs because it's the key success of an application in today's market. Something that is unique, appealing, interesting and contains a WOW factor is likely to be used by millions and wouldn't even require advertisements. Ofcourse the idea of the application is important as well as design but design is something that will actually make the best out of it.</p>

                <h1>YouTube</h1>
                <p>I've been using TouTube since high school and most of my knowledge is obtained from YouTube ever since I joined my computing course at the University. YouTube is one of the biggest source of learning because is free, up to date and provides variety of ways to accomplish desired results. That being said, many of my applications, college work and additional projects are created by following variety of YouTube tutorials and mixing them together. </p>

                <h1>Gaming</h1>
                <p>My first ever gaming device was GameBoy Advance which I really enjoyed and the first game I ever played was Star Wars. However, I was a big fan of Pokemon games on GameBoy even though I did not own one. From then on as years went past, I bought more games and consoles and today the only console which I occasionally is the XBOX ONE. I am a big fan of RPG and MMORPG games because it mixed with fun, requires dedication, strategy and ofcourse time. At this moment, I don't game much but planning to move back into it soon enough.</p>
