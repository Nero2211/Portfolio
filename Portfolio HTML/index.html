                    First of all, Welcome to my site
                    <br><br>
                    My name is Kartik and I am aspiring to become a Software/Application Development. But the question is WHY and HOW did it start?
                    <br><br>
                    Since high school, I had a key interest in playing, hacking and creating/downloading additional gaming contents. Sooner or later, I became interested in how these aspects are achieved. Game designing was understandable but I didn’t understand how additional applications are created which would manipulate the contents of a game. This is when the stage when it triggered a drive within me to learn this aspect but I was unsure if I was able to create a career out of this. 
                    <br><br>
                    After thinking about this career, I decided to study Computer Science for one year in College to gain insight of the course and aspects I will be dealing with on day to day basis. This is the moment I realised, this is the career I not only want to participate in but also make development my primary career path. As I do not have any development experience prior to my course nor do I come from a development background, I was quite satisfied with how things turned out to be. I’ve also found my own potential at this stage and how I can push myself even further to achieve maximum results.

All of this started off which a simple project designed in Eclipse which I was not satisfied with as it was back-end development project with no interface attached. However, the moment I participated in the Mobile Development Unit, it was the turning point. The reason being because I was able to create application on my favourite platform and at that stage, I was filled with numerous application ideas which I would be developing in near future.</p>

                                <p class="subDescription subResponsiveFont blackFont" id="subDescriptionWorkIndex">C# was the first programming language which was introduced on the course. It all started with simple calculations and looking at different types of variables. However, the moment I started to work with different types of control using Visual Studio, I realised the potential of Visual Studio using C# to create desktop based software. Furthermore, I’ve noticed that C# programming language is also capable of creating simulating user behaviour on computer. Meaning that I can use C# to create automated tools which can be used to eliminate daily tasks. However, this is only a theory as I am yet to practice this simulation process which I will be attending in near future.</p>

I am always open to idea of development and ideas where I am able to challenge and push my own potential to achieve greater results. My primary plan is to participate in creating a development tool rather than application/software using development tool. Till today, I am curious how development tools are designed, the number of people participating in the development process, the amount of work put into it and potentially the life expectancy of these development tools.</p>

At this stage, I’ve not created many projects because of limited free time but I am to force myself in 2018 to change this and create complex projects which I will be using to showcase my work and my skills. This might involve simple interface creation using Adobe Photoshop/After Effects. Depending on resources available for the project, I will even push myself further in order to finish the project and launch it on PlayStore or share it with my friends if it’s a Desktop Application. At the end, it all comes down to how diverse and creative my projects are.</p>

I’ll have to take further steps in learning most demanded languages or languages with the most potential. This is because I do not want to become a limited developer but a limitless developer. I want to be able to develop majority of my ideas/strategy and if not be able to develop, at least be able to consult the appropriate strategy to develop the solution.</p>
