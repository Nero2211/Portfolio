                    Graduated from Walsall College w/ Birmingham City University and starting to develop my career in the programming world.... <br><br>
                    The first solution I built was a self service check out system using a barcode scanner (college project) in C# and the outcome of the project gave me a goal to chase.... <br><br>
                    My main fuel which wakes me up every morning is the potential of being able to develop a system/application/website/software for a client or colleague and knowing the solution will be used by others.... <br><br>

                    <p class="subDescription">During my second year in College, I was introduced to Android Studio development tool which is widely popular amongst Android Applications. At first, the tool was rather intimidating because I there are number of things about this tool I did not understand at that stage and some at this point of time. However, the moment I developed my first application, the tool become user friendly and I started to remember majority of it's components. It is difficult to come up with a new idea for an application as majority of the contents are already covered. However, this does not stop me from making application. Constantly, I will look at current applications and make judgements based on their apperance, functionality and features... </p>
