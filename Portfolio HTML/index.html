                    Graduated from Walsall College w/ Birmingham City University and starting to develop my career in the programming world.... <br><br>
                    The first solution I built was a self service check out system using a barcode scanner (college project) in C# and the outcome of the project gave me a goal to chase.... <br><br>
                    My main fuel which wakes me up every morning is the potential of being able to develop a system/application/website/software for a client or colleague and knowing the solution will be used by others.... <br><br>
