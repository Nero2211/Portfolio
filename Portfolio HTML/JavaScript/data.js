All of this started off which a simple project designed in Eclipse which I was not satisfied with as it was back-end development project with no interface attached. However, the moment I participated in the Mobile Development Unit, it was the turning point. The reason being because I was able to create application on my favourite platform and at that stage, I was filled with numerous application ideas which I would be developing in near future.",

However, the moment I started to work with different types of control using Visual Studio, I realised the potential of Visual Studio using C# to create desktop based software. Furthermore, Iâ€™ve noticed that C# programming language is also capable of creating simulating user behaviour on computer. Meaning that I can use C# to create automated tools which can be used to eliminate daily tasks. However, this is only a theory as I am yet to practice this simulation process which I will be attending in near future.",

Secondarily, that style and formatting is consistent and meets the basic principles laid out in Wikipedia's Manual of Style. The guidelines for the New pages patrol and Recent changes patrol also apply, merely the search method is different.",
